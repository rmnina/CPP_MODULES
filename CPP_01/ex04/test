A polydactyl cat is a cat with a congenital physical anomaly called polydactyly (also known as polydactylism 
or hyperdactyly), which causes the cat to be born with more than the usual number of toes on one or more of 
its paws. Cats with this genetically inherited trait are most commonly found along the East Coast of North 
America (in the United States and Canada) and in South West England and Wales.

Polydactyly is a congenital abnormality that can be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Some cases of 
polydactyly are caused by mutations in the ZRS, a genetic enhancer that regulates expression of the sonic 
hedgehog (SHH) gene in the limb. The SHH protein is an important signalling molecule involved in 
patterning of many body elements, including limbs and digits.

Normal cats have a total of 18 toes, with five toes on each fore paw, and four toes on each hind paw; 
polydactyl cats may have as many as nine digits on their front or hind paws. Both Jake, a Canadian polydactyl 
cat, and Paws, an American polydactyl cat, were recognised by Guinness World Records as having the highest 
number of toes on a cat, 28. Tigger, a tabby polydactyl cat, also had 28 toes, but passed before it could be 
verified by Guinness World Records. Various combinations of anywhere from four to seven toes per paw are 
common. Polydactyly is most commonly found on the front paws only; it is rare for a cat to have polydactyl 
hind paws only, and polydactyly of all four paws is even less common.

The condition seems to be most commonly found in cats along the East Coast of North America (in the United 
States and Canada) and in South West England, Wales and Kingston-upon-Hull. Polydactyl cats have been 
extremely popular as ship's cats. Although there is some controversy over whether the most common variant 
of the trait originated as a mutation in New England or was brought there from Britain, there seems to be 
agreement that it spread widely as a result of cats carried on ships originating in Boston, Massachusetts, 
and the prevalence of polydactyly among the cat population of various ports correlates with the dates when 
they first established trade with Boston. Contributing to the spread of polydactyl cats by this means, 
sailors were long known to value polydactyl cats especially for their extraordinary climbing and hunting 
abilities as an aid in controlling shipboard rodents. Some sailors thought they bring good luck at sea.
The rarity of polydactyl cats in Europe may be because they were hunted and killed based on superstitions 
about witchcraft.

Genetic work studying the DNA basis of the condition indicates that many different mutations in the same ZRS 
area can all lead to polydactyly.

Author Ernest Hemingway became a famous aficionado of polydactyl cats after a ship captain gave him a 
six-toed cat that he named Snowball. Upon Hemingway's death in 1961, his former home in Key West, Florida, 
became a museum and a home for his cats, and it currently houses approximately 50 descendants of his cats 
(about half of which are polydactyl). Because of his love for these animals, polydactyl cats are sometimes 
referred to as "Hemingway cats".
